-How about running Smoldyn directly on a 2D plane?
-Can't do that! VCell spatial stochastic models only support 3D geometry

For a reaction in 3D A+A->X, the input on rate half. Due to 1/2 convention, front factor. So if you want to simulate a reaction with Kon, you have to input Kon/2 in vcell.

Noticed the warning message “Mass Action Kinetics is not suitable for 2nd order membrane reaction” in the reactions table.

Smoldyn cannot simulate A->B+C+D

VCell has problems outputting data with more than 1e5 data points, so for some of the Smoldyn simulations, we had to do short and long runs with different output values.
